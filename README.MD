# Development Purpose

As the “Live streaming commerce”, a shopping method for purchasing products, expands;
various platforms such as Taobao Live (淘宝直播), Tik Tok (抖音,Tik Tok), and Kwai (快手) were created. 

There are 560 million users of these local services. The companies that have discontinued store sales have recruited 
‘Wang Hong (网红, a famous influencer)’ to broadcast store tours, promotions, fashion shows, etc. The broadcast in which
Wang Hong appeared received tens of millions of views and sold-out promotional products.

According to the Ministry of Commerce of China, the number of live streaming commerce
broadcasts and the number of products sold during the 2020 Labor Day holiday (May 1-5)
increased twice and 5.7 times each compared to the same period last year.

As the boundaries between offline retailers and online specialists disappeared, consumers need
to build an omni-channel where they can search for products through various channels such as
mobile, web sites, and social media, and freely use post services such as ordering and
consumption
